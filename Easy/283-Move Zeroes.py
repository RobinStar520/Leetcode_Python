# Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

# Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
# Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0]
# Output: [0]
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 

# Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

# Approach:
# Get the number of zeros, and then remove all zeros and append the same number of zeros to the list.
