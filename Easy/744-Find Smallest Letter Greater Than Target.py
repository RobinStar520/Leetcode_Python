# You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

# Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
# Output: "c"
# Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
# Example 2:

# Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
# Output: "f"
# Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
# Example 3:

# Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
# Output: "x"
# Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= letters.length <= 104
# letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
# letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# letters contains at least two different characters.
# target is a lowercase English letter.

# Approach:
# Use a loop tp find the result.

class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        result: str = letters[0]
        diff: int = 999
        for letter in letters:
            gap: int = abs(ord(letter) - ord(target))
            if gap < diff and ord(letter) > ord(target):
                diff = gap
                result = letter
        return result
